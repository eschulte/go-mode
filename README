go-mode

An Emacs mode for playing go and parsing/navigating/editing sgf files.

Intended functionality:
- reading and writing between sgf files and lisp trees,
- translate between sgf and gtp, igs text commands, and maybe gmp
- communication with local and remote go programs and players
- viewing/editing sgf files, and playing games through a Go board interface
