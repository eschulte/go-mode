* Tasks (TODOs)

** TODO build in an internal representation of an event

should basically be the intersection of those parts of the game...
- black moves
- white moves
- set boardsize
- set komi
- undo previous move etc...
which are common between GTP, SGF, and GMP

for starters lets say...
| event-type           | argument      | representation                      |
|----------------------+---------------+-------------------------------------|
| set_board size       | int           | (:board_size 19)                    |
| set_komi             | float         | (:komi 0.5)                         |
| place_handicap_stone | color, vertex | (:handicap 'white 'Q4)              |
| move                 | color, vertex | (:move 'black 'Q4)                  |
| comment              | who, text     | (:comment "schulte" "text comment") |
| undo                 | none          | (:undo)                             |

and we can represent them as lists

(:symbol &rest data...)

** TODO rename everything from sgf to go

doing this now, and re-organizing the files...

** TODO actually get this playing games [/]

this means...
- [ ] define GO mode or go-start-game to get things going
- [ ] gtp translation working
- [ ] board functions working

This needs to initiate...
- [ ] blank board buffer
- [ ] blank sgf tree
- [ ] start a gnugo process

** TODO translations [/]

- [ ] gtp <-> move
- [ ] sgf <-> move

** TODO go-board [/]
flesh out all of the board functions

*** go-board-mode

Some things to keep in mind [[info:elisp:Major%20Modes][info:elisp:Major Modes]]

- The mode should specify how to do highlighting for Font Lock mode,
  by setting up a buffer-local value for the variable
  `font-lock-defaults' (*note Font Lock Mode::).
- The mode should specify how Imenu should find the definitions or
  sections of a buffer, by setting up a buffer-local value for the
  variable `imenu-generic-expression', for the two variables
  `imenu-prev-index-position-function' and
  `imenu-extract-index-name-function', or for the variable
  `imenu-create-index-function' (*note Imenu::).
- The mode can specify a local value for
  `eldoc-documentation-function' to tell ElDoc mode how to handle this
  mode.


* Notes

** GO formats

*** SGF
Intended for recording GO Games including played moves, alternate
variations, comments, etc...
- [[http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/]]

*** GTP
Mainly intended for communication with go programs.
- [[http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/]]
- [[http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html][specs]]
