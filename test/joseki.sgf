Choosing a joseki:
Since josekis work effectively in a certain direction, examine positions at adjacent corners and sides before choosing a joseki. The opposite corner matters only if a ladder is involved. Some guidelines:
1. Have support for a fight - A high position provides support, a low position does not.
2. Take the side with most value -
2a. A juncture point for both sides is of great value.
2b. A side where making territory is uncertain is of little value.
3. Consider strategic balance.
4. Get sente, if there are more big points on the board.

If there are two variations with similar outcome, but one with a ladder and one without, avoid the ladder, because you don't need to risk an opponent's ladder breaker.

How to learn joseki:
If you don't know joseki or a specific joseki, which you want to learn, don't try to remember every single branching, you find here. Look first for the main and correct variations, which are marked out with a '*', and try to remember the most easy ones of them. You don't need to know each branching you find here.
When you learn a joseki, look also for the follow-ups in the middle- and end-game.
Use a new learned joseki in your real games, immediately after you learned it, until you can vizualize it coming onto the board in a rush, without trying to stress your memory in search of each next joseki-move.
If something goes wrong or you want to know more, look up the variations of deviations, special strategies, trick plays and mistakes here. To understand, why there are only for special situations or mistakes anytime, compare their results with the results of good variations in nearby branchings instead of looking at their results for themselves. Open this file twice to put two results beside each other on your screen.

(;B[qc]N[san-san (3-3 point)]
C[The san-san (3-3) point, emphasizing territory at the expense of influence (especially following an approach at 'a'). 

All joseki for the 3-3 point are relatively simple.

White approaches are 'a *' to 'c *'. White 'b *' to 'e' are played when the top side is favored (such as an extension).

(;W[pd]N[katatsuki (shoulder hit) (a)]
C[The shoulder-hit is the traditional answer to the 3-3.

The direction of Black 3 depends on the positions on the side.

Crawling once may be the premise for a follow-up move of sliding with a knight's move in the opposite direction. If Black plays 3 at 'a' (to the right), the follow-on knight's move is then played at the top. Black's knight's move reduces territory potential on the side it is played. 

Given a White stone at top, White 2 would be a mistake. In such a case, White should have played an extension from that stone, rather than White 2.

Black joseki continues with 'a *'. Black 'b' and 'c' show a special strategy.

For variations of Black playing elsewhere, see the 4-4 point branch.

C[Black continues with 'a *', 'b *' or 'c'. Black 'd' is seen occasionally in amateur games.

Black 'a' and 'b' favor the top, while Black 'c' (and 'd') emphasize the right side (to the potential sacrifice of giving White thickness at the top).

Black 'e' and 'f' are not recommended.

Black 'g' shows Black playing elsewhere.

White 'c' is a mistake, as White's stones are disconnected.

C[Black 1 is a pincer play said to have been developed by the 4th Honinbo Dosaku (1645-1702). This move maintains overall balance while attacking the White kakari stone. It is often used when there is a White stone on the top-left star-point.

White's responses range from 'a *', 'b *', 'c *', 'd *', 'e *'.'f' or g', and include playing elsewhere 'h *'.

White may need the ladder to play 'c'.

White reply at 'i' comes from a 19th century Japanese game.

'j' was played professionally.

C[The great master Honinbo Shuei (1852-1906) favored the two-space high (niken taka-gakari) approach, especially in two stone handicap games. This approach move was very popular in the 1910s. Go Seigen frequently played this way, considering it a good "whole board" approach. In recent years, O Rissei has often used the two-space high approach.

Almost all variations have been completely explored. 

Black plays 'a *', 'b *', 'c *', 'd', 'e *', elsewhere ('f') or 'k'.
'd' secures the corner, but is submissive. 'g' attaches to a weak stone, forcing it to strengthen. 'h' is an overplay. 'j' and 'k' are not recommended.

White 'c' erases aji in the corner for White.

If there is already a Black stone on the triangled position like in the Chinese Fuseki, White 1 was maybe doubtful. 'd' shows punishment variation to be compared with the 'a' variations.

C[Black 3 is the most orthodox reply to White 2.

White continues with 'a *', 'b *' or 'e'. 

White 'b' leads to the avalanche pattern, which has complex variations. Black has the initial choice of joseki with this pattern. The outcome is typically Black gets the corner and out on the side, White thickness.

White may also play elsewhere ('c').

C[Black 3 is a relatively modern invention. It is a severe move which restricts White's movements.

White responds with 'a *', 'b *', 'c *' or 'f' (joseki).
One of the variations after 'c' is called "the magic sword of Muramasa". Although its joseki are not difficult, its mistake refutations are hair-raising.
White 'f' was considered inferior until a new joseki variation was developed.

White 'd' is unfavorable with this pincer, as the pincer is in the way of White's extension.

Var 5 ('e') shows White playing elsewhere (which is rare).

'h' is inferior.

'i' is a special strategy, if White has something like the High Chinese Fuseki on the lower side..

a1 - Black right, White top

C[The star or hoshi (4-4) point, emphasizing influence at the potential expense of territory.

The first experiments with the star point were around 1840 in Japan; its first appearances in pro games date to the early 1900's. Its rise to preeminence came during the 'New Fuseki' movement in Japan in the mid-1930's.

White approaches with 'a *', 'b *', 'c *' or 'd *'.  White 'a' is the standard approach move, the variations after it cover the great majority of hoshi joseki.
Other approaches invite a local loss, but may make sense strategically.

'e' covers White playing elsewhere. These variations show White approaches when there are multiple Black stones locally.

'f' shows invasion (which is not joseki).

'g *' shows a splitting move when Black has already played at the top.

'h' is feasible if strategically sensible.

'i' is a move on the side preparing to approach from the other side.

'j' is covered in another branching..

Black joseki responses range from 'a *', 'b *', 'c *', 'd', 'e *', 'f *', 'g *', 'h *', 'i' or 'p'. 

The variations after 'a *' and 'c *' should be studied together to understand similarities and differences.

'b' leads to much more complications than the other answers, but White can simplify.

'd' is called Tsuke-Nobi-Joseki. Its shape also occurs on the side without corner.

'j', 'k', & 'n' show a special strategy based upon fuseki.
'l' shows Black ignorning the approach move (White 2).
'm' shows the greedy play of using the star point immediately for territory.
'o' is not generally favorable for Black, nor joseki.
'q' is a trick play.
'r' is covered in another branching.
's' is possible if White is not on the top side.

C[Black 3, the two-space low pincer, at best indicates a special strategy. 

The two-space low pincer is not as forceful as the one-space pincer, nor as relaxed as the three-space pincer, which is most often used as a dual purpose move to pincer and extend at the same time. Neither fish nor fowl, the two-space low pincer is less able to secure territory compared to the one-space pincer, if the selected variation comes to that, and perhaps more likely to later come under attack if White establishes a base for White 2.

C[The mokuhazushi (5-3) point was popular in the Edo period in Japan (1600 - 1867). It emphasizes influence; territorially, it is inferior to the 3-4 point. 

Approach moves for White range from 'a *', 'b *' or 'c *'.  White 'a' is typical.

After 'a', the 5-3 point can lead to different complicated joseki: the taisha and the near low pincer. Both can be avoided or simplified.

White 'b' forfeits the corner, and emphasizes the right side, so locally this is disadvantageous for White. 

White 'c' leads to a division of profit for White and influence for Black. A ladder helps when playing White 'c'.

White 'd' is played by amateurs who don't know 3,5-point-joseki and professionals in situations where an equal result in this corner is unimportant. 'd' is inferior to 'a', 'b' and 'c'.

White 'e' can be played as part of center-moyo-strategy, but is not joseki, but more like playing a reduction after tenuki once.

After White plays tenuki 'f', Black can choose between two shimari and a trick play.

C[White 2 is the standard approach because of its solidity and stability.

Black replies with 'a *', 'b *', 'c *', 'd *', 'e *', 'f *', 'g *', 'h *', 'i *', 'j'

Black 'd' is strategically correct, if there is a Black stone on the triangled, a White stone on the squared point.

The most difficult of all joseki is the taisha 'i'. Once Black has played this move, he has only one inferior move to simplify. So, if he doesn't know the '1000 variations', he may well choose one of the five pincers, who are much easier. But if he knows them and White does not, White need not fear Black 'i', because he still has several opportunities to avoid the complex variations with an equal or well acceptable result.
'e' is the most complicated of the five pincers, you may well learn it at least. White can simplify.

'k' is a mistake.
